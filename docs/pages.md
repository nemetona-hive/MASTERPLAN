# Pages and routing

*Part of the [MASTERPLAN developer guide](../MASTERPLAN_DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md).*

## Pages & routing

Hash-based routing (`#page-id`). Home = no hash.
Page render is handled in `MainPageContent` in App.jsx — add new pages there.
Nav items come from `PAGES` global — add new pages in config (outside src/).
The list is **flat**. Nav.jsx used to carry generic group machinery — nested
pages via `parentId`/`isParent`, expand/collapse, a chevron, auto-open on
navigating to a child — kept against a grouped page that was never added. It is
gone, along with its stylesheet half (`.nav-parent`, `.nav-sub-btn`,
`.child-active`, `.nav-parent-chevron`). Grouping the nav means writing it
again, deliberately, against a real requirement.

Current pages: `home`, `pattern-layout`, `symmetric-layout`, `concrete`,
`golden-ratio`, `pipe-wrap`, `guider`, `timesheet`.

Sidebar interaction (Nav.jsx): Ctrl/Cmd+B toggles collapse globally (App.jsx);
double-clicking any nav button does the same. Arrow keys rove the list on both
axes — Down/Right step forward, Up/Left step back — over `.nav-btn` elements
found in the DOM. Roving
deliberately stops at both ends rather than wrapping.

Collapsed-nav tooltips mount
into `document.body` via a portal on hover/focus rather than sitting inside
`.nav` — that container is `overflow-y: auto`, and a tooltip parked inside it
either clips or forces the sidebar itself into horizontal scroll. The
collapsed header disables click-to-home (Home stays reachable via its own
nav item, which renders in every state) since the header shrinks to just the
toggle icon but the div still spans the full strip.

## Page components

All calculators and pages are stored as standalone files inside `src/components/`:

| Page ID | Component | Location | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `home` | `SheetHome` | `components/Home.jsx` | Main landing page menu |
| `pattern-layout` | `SheetSurfaceLayout` | `components/SurfaceLayout.jsx` | Compares straight, shifted, stepped, and long-short layout strategies |
| `symmetric-layout` | `SheetSymmetricLayout` | `components/SymmetricLayout.jsx` | Equal edge pieces with full panels in the center |
| `golden-ratio` | `SheetGoldenRatio` | `components/GoldenRatio.jsx` | Calculates Phi sequences |
| `pipe-wrap` | `PipeWrapCalculator` | `components/PipeWrapCalculator.jsx` | Pipe wrap length calculator with SVG diagram |
| `concrete` | `SheetConcrete` | `components/Concrete.jsx` | Concrete consumption estimator |
| `guider` | `SheetGuider` | `components/Guider.jsx` | Reference/guide pages (e.g. electrical wiring diagrams) with an entry list panel |
| `timesheet` | `SheetTimesheet` | `components/Timesheet.jsx` | Work hours calculator |

## Golden Ratio tool

PHI = 1.6180339887499. Builds 7 descending steps: `base / PHI^n`.
Cards use tone system (a/b/c/d) for visual identity.
`useLinkedCardHighlight` hook links control cards to preview cards on click.

## Guider tool

Reference/guide page with a selectable entry list (`ControlPanel` on the left, detail view on the right).
Currently ships wiring-diagram entries (`Lihtlüliti`, `Veksellüliti`) built as inline SVG schematics
inside `components/Guider.jsx` — square dashed switch boxes with open-circle contacts and a floating
lever, consistent stroke widths (`r=4.5`, `strokeWidth=2`), and a legend/Ühendused list below each
diagram. New entries are added to the `ENTRIES` array in `SheetGuider`.
